  image: BSCCOgap.png
  description: In this work we report an original procedure for manufacturing glass-fiber epoxy reinforced nanocomposites (GFECs) by employing electrospun fiber-mats as a reinforcing phase. These fibers have been produced from polyacrylonitrile and multiwalled carbon nanotubes solutions. Optimal protocols are designed by combining Taguchi method with the morphological, structural and mechanical properties obtained by scanning electron microscopy, profilometry and tensile tests.

- title: "Deformation Analysis of 3D Printed Metacarpophalangeal and Interphalangeal Joints via Transfer Learning"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: we print the personalized metacarpal casts/braces (MCB) via fused deposition modeling (FDM), and investigate their mechanical properties to ensure the desired functionality. However, printing the full-size MCB is time-consuming (takes more than 11 hours in our design), making it hard to collect a sufficient data set for the mechanical properties investigation. Here, we explore the utilization of reduced-size MCB to facilitate the analysis of full-size MCB via transfer learning. In particular, three critical process variables (i.e., raster width, layer height, and extrusion temperature) were varied, and a universal testing machine was used to measure the total deformation of the MCB.

- title: "Online droplet anomaly detection from streaming videos in inkjet printing"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: The objective of this work is to build an analytical framework that allows for online droplet anomaly detection from droplet videos. There are several challenges that have not been addressed before (1) the features of the droplet videos need to be extracted in an online fashion; and (2) there is no well-defined baseline to support the droplet anomalies detection, due to the complex process dynamics. Here, we propose a novel online framework to efficiently detect the anomalies from process streaming videos. In particular, we extend the multivariate Bayesian online change detection (BOCD) framework to high-dimensional data (i.e., tensor data of droplet videos) by leveraging online tensor factorization (OTF).

- title: "Unsupervised learning for the droplet evolution prediction and process dynamics understanding in inkjet printing"
  image: YSR.png
  description: this paper takes the video data as the study subject to investigate the droplet evolution behavior in the inkjet printing process. Moreover, this paper introduces a deep learning method for the study of such video data. Compared to most of the current learning approaches conducted in a supervised/semi-supervised manner for manufacturing process data, we propose an unsupervised learning method for studying the flow pattern of the droplet, which does not require well-defined ground-truth labels. Regarding the spatial and temporal transformation of the droplet in video data, we apply a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) to implement the proposed unsupervised learning. To verify the hypothesis that the proposed method can learn a latent representation for reproducing original data, the proposed DRNN is trained and tested on both simulation and experimental datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can learn latent representations of the droplet jetting process video data, which is very useful for the prediction of the droplet behavior.

- title: "Spatiotemporal Fusion Network for the Droplet Behavior Recognition in Inkjet Printing"
  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: A novel feature identification framework is presented to recognize the spatiotemporal feature of in-situ monitoring videos for inkjet printing. Specifically, a spatiotemporal fusion network is used for droplet printing behavior classification. The categories are based on inkjet printability, which is related to both the static features (ligament, satellite, and meniscus) and dynamic features (ligament thinning, droplet pinch off, meniscus oscillation). For the recorded droplet jetting video data, two streams of networks, the frames sampled from video in spatial domain (associated with static features) and the optical flow in temporal domain (associated with dynamic features), are fused in different ways to recognize the droplet evolving behavior

- title: "A machine learning approach to model the electrospinning process of biocompatible materials"
  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: this paper systematically studies the electrospinning process of a biocompatible polymer (i.e., polyacrylonitrile (PAN) 10%) via experimental study and data-driven modeling. In particular, three critical process variables (i.e., voltage, tip-to-collector distance, and polymer flow rate), are varied in a central composite design of experiment. Twenty-four runs are executed for the data collection, during which the in-situ measurements are collected via a customized sensing system. After each experiment, scanning electron microscope (SEM) images are taken from the nonwoven mats and characterized to capture the diameter and the diameter variations. Three machine learning methods, Lasso, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM), are applied to the collected data.

- title: "Sketch-based tensor decomposition for non-parametric monitoring of electrospinning processes"
  image: Direct.png
  authors: Luis Javier Segura, Christian Narváez Muñoz, Chi Zhou, Hongyue Sun
  description: This work aims to designing a fast process monitoring tool from scratch for monitoring the dynamic electrospinning process based on the Taylor cone and jet videos. Nevertheless, this is challenging since the videos are of high frequency and high dimension, and the monitoring statistics may not have a parametric distribution. To achieve this goal, a framework integrating image analysis, sketch-based tensor decomposition, and non-parametric monitoring, is proposed. In particular, we use Tucker tensor-sketch (Tucker-TS) based tensor decomposition to extract the sparse structure representations of the videos. Additionally, the extracted monitoring variables are non-normally distributed, hence non-parametric bootstrap Hotelling T2 control chart is deployed to handle this issue during the monitoring. The framework is demonstrated by electrospinning a PAN-based polymeric solution.

  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  authors: Luis Javier Segura, Guanglei Zhao, Chi Zhou, Hongyue Sun
  description: The objective of this work is to build an efficient emulator for the physical model. There are several challenges unaddressed before (1) the solidification time at various locations, which is a multi-dimensional array response, needs to be modeled and (2) the construction and evaluation of the emulator at new process settings need to be quick and accurate. Here, we integrate joint tensor decomposition and nearest neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) to construct an efficient multi-dimensional array response emulator with process settings as inputs. Specifically, structured joint tensor decomposition decomposes the multi-dimensional array responses at various process settings into the setting-specific core tensors and shared low-dimensional factorization matrices.

  image: TBG_ARPES.png
  description: In this paper, we integrate machine learning (i.e., tensor decomposition) methods and physical models to emulate the tensor responses of droplet solidification time from the physical based models. The tensor responses are factorized with joint tensor decomposition, and represented with low dimensional vectors. We then model these low dimensional vectors with Gaussian process models. We demonstrate the proposed framework for emulating the physical models of freeze nano 3D printing, which can help the future real-time process optimization.

- title: "Experimental study of the incidence of changing a synthetic jet orifice in heat transfer using a Taguchi method approach"
  image: STS_news.png
  description: The current study allows the recognition of the most optimal combination of excitation frequency, kind of orifice, and synthetic jet-to-surface spacing in order to obtain the fastest cooling time using a Taguchi experimental design. To this end, the heat transfer and synthetic jet velocity behavior using different kinds of orifices are obtained experimentally. A piezoelectric diaphragm has been selected as a vibrating actuator. Four kinds of orifices have been studied; circular, rectangular, triangular, and square. First, the study consists of recognizing the excitation frequency in which each orifice produces the highest flow velocity. A hotwire anemometer has been used in order to measure the synthetic jet velocity. Additionally, a steel plate has been heated and then cooled using the synthetic jet set at the excitation frequency in which the jet velocity was the largest for each orifice.
